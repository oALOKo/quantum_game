                <p>
                    Quantum Squares is a thrilling, turn-based strategy game
                    played on a 5x5 grid. In this game, you and your opponent
                    take turns placing quantum particles into squares, aiming to
                    control the grid by mastering the art of particle
                    distribution. But be cautious—filling squares can cause
                    collapses, leading to exciting chain reactions!

                <h2>Rules & Gameplay</h2>
                <ul class="rules-list">
                    <li><strong>Grid Setup:</strong> The game is played on a 5x5
                        grid. Each square can hold up to 4 quantum particles.
                        All squares start empty.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn Structure:</strong> On each turn, place one
                        particle in a square you own or in any neutral square.
                        Fill a square to 4 particles to control it!</li>
                    <li><strong>Collapse Mechanism:</strong> When a square
                        reaches 4 particles, it collapses, redistributing its
                        particles to adjacent squares. Control shifts, but you
                        retain the points!</li>
                    <li><strong>Chain Reactions:</strong> Collapsing squares can
                        cause neighboring squares to collapse, setting off
                        dynamic chain reactions that shake the entire grid!</li>
                    <li><strong>Game End:</strong> The game ends when a player
                        controls 10 squares or when no valid moves are left. The
                        player with the most points wins!</li>
                </ul>
